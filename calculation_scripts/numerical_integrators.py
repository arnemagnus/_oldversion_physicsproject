# This file contains a set of numerical integration schemes for
# general-purpose use. To this end, the integrators are implemented
# with a consistent call signature. In addition, they can handle 
# any number of coordinates, as long as a function returning the
# derivative (RHS) is provided for each of them.

# Changelog: 
#     2017-08-25: File created. 
#                 Explicit Euler method, Heun's method, 
#                 Kutta's method and the classical RK4 method added.
#                 Added spaces (whitespace) everywhere slopes are 
#                 estimated, in order to make the differences between
#                 the various methods more apparent.
#     2017-08-30: Clarified the function signature for the derivative
#                 functions.
