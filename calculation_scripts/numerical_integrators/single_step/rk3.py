# Changelog:
#     2017-08-25: Explicit Kutta scheme successfully implemented
#                 for the first time, albeit with a radically
#                 different overhanging file structure.
#
#     2017-08-30: Function signature for the derivative function
#                 standardized clarified (via code comments)
#
#     2017-09-01: Changed function signature of the integrator as well
#                 as the derivative function, from f(x,t) --> f(t,x),
#                 in accordance with convention from literature.
#
#     2017-09-19: Radically altered the structure of the numerical
#                 integrator package. From here on out, each 
#                 integrator is contained within its own file, 
#                 facilitating finding any given integrator in the
#                 event that changes must be made.
#
#                 In addition, the integrators now follow a more 
#                 logical hierarchial system, with single-step
#                 integrators clearly differentiated from their
#                 multi-step brethren, for instance.
#
#                 This change was partially made with multi-step
#                 methods in mind, where a single-step method
#                 must be used at the first step, but also as a means
#                 to provide more robust program code which should
#                 be easier to maintain than was the case for my
#                 original structure.

def rk3(t, x, h, f):
   """This function performs a single time step forwards, using the
   Kutta (RK3) scheme, finding an approximation of the coordinates at

   The Kutta scheme is a member of the Runge-Kutta family of ODE
   solvers, and is third-order accurate.

   Input:
      t: Current time level
      x: Current coordinates, array-like
      h: Time increment (fixed)
      f: Function handle for the derivatives (the RHS of the ODE
             system), function signature: f = f(t, x)

   Output:
      _t: New time level
      _x: Kutta approximation of the coordinates at the
              new time level
      _h: Time increment (unaltered, yet returned, in order for
              the return variable signatures of the numerical
              integrators to remain consistent across single-,
              multi- and adaptive step methods
